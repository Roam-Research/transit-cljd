:section Done

   [✓] Organize src and test code under high level 'cljd' directory, with
   appropriate changes to deps.edn.

   [✓] The quick example, put that in a test file.

   [✓] In dart_test.yaml we can set the test directory. And if we make our
   namespaces something_test, the resulting file will be named with an
   underscore, too, so Dart will pick them up as valid tests.
