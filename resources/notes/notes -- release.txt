:section Instructions

   To update the version build execute this command (note that extra args to the
   -T command are EDN and strings have to be escaped differently):

   ```
      clj -T:build release :notes '["change note 1" "change note 2"]'

:section Thoughts

   I wanted to use Clojure's build tools to update the version numbers in the
   various places, and commit and push. The typical way to replace version
   numbers in your files is to use `sed`. But what a pain. I'm not a sed expert.
   I can spend the time to figure out the exact incantation and deal with all
   the extra escaping, but why? In a week I'll forget how I did it and look back
   at it and have no idea what it is doing.

   But I do know Clojure. I can do in Clojure exactly what I'm attempting to do
   in sed, and it will stay understandable to me. And I can narrow in and do
   specifically what I want. And I can easily test in a non-destructive way in
   the repl. Wins all around.

   This is nothing against sed. It can obviously do everything I need to do, and
   in fact I know that because I first did this all with sed. But then I decided
   on a better way.
